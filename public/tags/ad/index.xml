      <description>Get user details from Azure AD Recently I came across a challenge in my work. We are using a CI tool and using an inbuilt authorization mechanism(roles) to control access to the users. CI tool is integrated with Azure AD. We had 300+ entries in the user &amp;gt; roles assignment list and reached the maximum limit.&#xA;We also know that there are multiple people who left the organization whose entries are still present.</description>
